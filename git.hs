-- GENERAL SYNTAX INFORMATION
-- a square on the board is represented by a coordinate tuple:
-- (int - distance from left of board, int - distance from white homerow)
-- both parts of tuple are zero indexed

-- when colour is passed as a parameter next to a board or list of boards 
-- it should always represent the NEXT player who will move on those boards
